### Algorithm:

1. Initialize a 3x3 grid (Tic-Tac-Toe board) with empty values.
2. Iterate through the given moves array and fill the grid with 'X' or 'O' based on the player's turn.
3. Check for the winner by examining rows, columns, and diagonals:
   - For each row, check if all elements are the same and not empty.
   - For each column, check if all elements are the same and not empty.
   - Check both main and anti-diagonals for equality.
   - If any condition is met, return the winner ('A' or 'B').
4. If no winner is found, check if the game is pending or a draw:
   - If the total number of moves is less than the total number of cells on the board, return "Pending."
   - If all cells are filled, return "Draw."

### Pseudocode:

```plaintext
function tictactoe(moves):
    n = 3
    Initialize a 3x3 grid (Tic-Tac-Toe board) with empty values

    // Fill the grid based on moves
    for i from 0 to length of moves - 1:
        row = moves[i][0]
        col = moves[i][1]
        player = determine player based on move index (even or odd)
        grid[row][col] = player's symbol ('X' or 'O')

    // Check for the winner
    for i from 0 to n - 1:
        // Check rows
        if grid[i][0] == grid[i][1] == grid[i][2] != '\0':
            return grid[i][0] == 'X' ? "A" : "B"

        // Check columns
        if grid[0][i] == grid[1][i] == grid[2][i] != '\0':
            return grid[0][i] == 'X' ? "A" : "B"

    // Check diagonals
    if grid[0][0] == grid[1][1] == grid[2][2] != '\0':
        return grid[0][0] == 'X' ? "A" : "B"

    if grid[0][2] == grid[1][1] == grid[2][0] != '\0':
        return grid[0][2] == 'X' ? "A" : "B"

    // Check if the game is pending or a draw
    if length of moves < n * n:
        return "Pending"
    else:
        return "Draw"
```
