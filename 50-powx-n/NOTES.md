# Algorithm:

1. **Base Case:** If `n` is equal to 0, return 1, as any number raised to the power 0 is 1.

2. **Recursive Step:**
   - Calculate `temp` as `myPow(x, n / 2)` to reduce the number of recursive calls.
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), return `temp * temp`.
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`), handle the positive or negative power cases:
      - If `n > 0`, return `x * temp * temp`.
      - If `n < 0`, return `(temp * temp) / x`.

# Explanation:

- The algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer strategy by splitting the problem into smaller subproblems, calculating the power for `n / 2` in each recursive call.
  
- If `n` is even, the result is obtained by squaring the `temp` value.

- If `n` is odd, the result is obtained by multiplying `x` with the square of `temp`. Additionally, the algorithm considers whether `n` is positive or negative, adjusting the result accordingly.

- This approach significantly reduces the number of recursive calls compared to a simple recursive solution, making it more efficient.

# Example:

Let's say you want to calculate `myPow(2.0, 5)`:

1. Initial call: `myPow(2.0, 5)`
   - Recursive call 1: `temp = myPow(2.0, 2)` (because `n / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2`)
     - Recursive call 2: `temp = myPow(2.0, 1)` (because `n / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1`)
       - Recursive call 3: `temp = myPow(2.0, 0)` (base case, returns 1)
     - Returning from Recursive call 2: returns `x * temp * temp = 2.0 * 1 * 1 = 2.0`
   - Returning from Recursive call 1: returns `temp * temp = 4.0`
   
2. Final result: `2.0 * 4.0 = 8.0`

This algorithm optimally handles both positive and negative powers, providing an efficient solution for calculating the power of a number.
