In the given line:

```java
return numList.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();
```

Here's what each part does:

1. `numList.stream()`: Converts the `numList` ArrayList to a Stream, which is a sequence of elements that can be processed in a functional style.

2. `.mapToInt(Integer::intValue)`: Maps each element in the stream to its integer value. It converts the stream of `Integer` objects to a stream of primitive `int`.

3. `.sum()`: Calculates the sum of all the elements in the stream. This returns the final result, which is the sum of the numeric values in the `numList`.

So, the entire expression is summing up the elements in the `numList` using the Java Stream API, providing a more concise and functional approach to calculate the sum of integers in the ArrayList.
